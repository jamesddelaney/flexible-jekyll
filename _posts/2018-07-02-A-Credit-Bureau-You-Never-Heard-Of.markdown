# [Think You’ve Got Your Credit Freezes Covered? Think Again.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/another-credit-freeze-target-nctue-com/)

It is time to setup a few more credit freezes!

> A freeze works to protect one’s credit file only if a potential creditor (or ID thief) tries to open a new line of credit at a company that uses one of the big three bureaus or Innovis. But Kerskie’s investigation revealed that the mobile phone merchants weren’t asking any of those four credit bureaus. Rather, the mobile providers that dinged the credit of Kerskie’s clients instead were making consumer credit queries with the National Consumer Telecommunications and Utilities Exchange (NCTUE), or nctue.com.

​The whole article is worth a read but this part is extra horrific:

> Many people who have succeeded in freezing their credit files with Equifax have nonetheless had their identities stolen and new accounts opened in their names thanks to a lesser-known credit bureau that seems to rely entirely on credit checking entites operated by Equifax.

​You can create the freeze here:

I just did it and it worked fine. Seems like they have cleaned things up a bit since this article was written in early may.

One interesting closing thought at the end of the article:

> “It’s frankly laughable that consumers should ever have to pay to freeze their credit files at all, and yet a recent study indicates that almost 20 percent of Americans chose to do so at one or more of the three major credit bureaus since Equifax announced its breach last fall. The total estimated cost to consumers in freeze fees? [$1.4 billion](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/survey-americans-spent-1-4b-on-credit-freeze-fees-in-wake-of-equifax-breach/). With a freeze on your files, the major credit bureaus stand to lose about one dollar for each time they might have been able to sell your credit report to a potential creditor, or potential identity thief.”

​In the age where so much values is placed on our personal data, the credit freeze is a way to vote with your wallet.

Incentives really seem out of wack here. Companies make money selling access to my credit report. This seems backwards. The berueau be able to sustain a viable business getting paid by the consumer to protect their credit data. This industry seems ripe for disruption.
